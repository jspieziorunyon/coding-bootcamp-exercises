# coding-bootcamp-exercises
Coding skill refresh: Boot.dev coursework, LeetCode, small exercises. Tracking daily progress while transitioning to scientific computing

Boot.dev Progress Reset: February 16, 2026
Starting fresh after subscription lapse.
Goal: Full backend path (Python & Go) while rebuilding for scientific/data engineering roles.
Day 1: Ch 1 submitted.

Feb 17, 2026 - Day 2:
- Finished Ch 4–8 (Scope, Testing/Debugging, Computing, Comparisons, Loops)
- Completed Training Grounds challenges for Ch 3–8
- Multiple commits added for each chapter
- Notes: Fundamentals clicking fast; loops felt natural. Pausing before Lists/Dictionaries to keep quality high.

Feb 18, 2026 - Day 3:
- Finished Chapter 9 (Lists) — took longer due to depth of Training Grounds
- Completed extra Training Grounds challenge: sorting + merging lists (challenging but great practice for real-world data manipulation)
- Started Chapter 10 (Dictionaries) intro
- Notes: Mutability, slicing, and iteration patterns clicking; edge cases are forcing good debugging habits. Energy good overall.

Feb 19, 2026 - Day 4:
- Finished Chapter 11 (Sets) including Training Grounds
- Added commits for set operations, membership checks, and edge cases
- Late start but consistent effort
- Holding off on Chapter 12 (Errors) to avoid rushing—will pick up tomorrow
- Notes: Sets clicked well after lists/dicts; debugger ready for upcoming logic/error work.
