Complete the meditate function using a while loop. It accepts:

mana: the current mana of the character.
max_mana: the maximum mana of the character.
num_potions: the number of mana potions the character has.
It consumes potions one at a time until either:

The character's mana has reached its maximum
The character has no more potions left
Each potion restores 1 point of mana.

When the meditation is over, it returns the player's mana and the number of potions left, in that order.
