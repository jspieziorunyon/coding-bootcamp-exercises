"""
Our players need a way to see how many copies of a specific item they have within their inventory!

Let's finish the get_item_counts function.

Within the loop, check if the items are the strings "Potion", "Bread", or "Shortsword".
If you find a match, increment the corresponding counter, either potion_count, bread_count or shortsword_count.

def get_item_counts(items):
    potion_count = 0
    bread_count = 0
    shortsword_count = 0

    # don't touch above this line

    for i in range(0, len(items)):
        if items[i] == "Potion":
            potion_count += 1
        elif items[i] == "Bread":
            bread_count += 1
        elif items[i] == "Shortsword":
            shortsword_count += 1

    # don't touch below this line

    return potion_count, bread_count, shortsword_count
